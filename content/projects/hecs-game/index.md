## Project Demo

WASD + space to move. Mouse to look around and scroll wheel to zoom.

Appologies for any jank with the html canvas. I don't have a huge amount of Html/Css experience.

{{ wasm_example(div_id="hecs_engine_wasm", src="dev/hecs_game.js", static=false) }}

This demo may not work, or have missing features on certain browsers. This example is not compatible with touch screen devices.
