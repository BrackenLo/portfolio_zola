# Introduction

Mau was our Derby University final year group project, spanning the second half of the academic year.

The lecturers decided to combine all of the Computer Games Programmers (CGP) and the Computer Graphics, 
Modelling, and Animation (CGMA) sudents into a single 'company', unlike previous years. As such, the team was
split into smaller sub-groups, each with a group lead. 

# The game

Mau is a boomer shooter game about the player who had their cat stolen by aliens and ventures out to get them back.

It was initially created using Unreal Engine 5.3 however was later ported to Unreal Engine 5.2

Due to licensing issues and uncertainty with the University, I am unable to provide a copy of the game, its assets or
source code.

## Group leader

With some of the most programming experience, I was made a lead for a group of 6 other programmers.

As one of the only members with Git experience, I volunteered to setup, manage, and maintain a Github repository
while teaching Git to the other programmers and some of the CGMA students. Due to inexperience amongst programmers,

Additionally, as one of the only members with Unreal c++ experience, I assisted with teaching many of the CGP
students with writing various systems in c++ such as health management, gun systems, vehicle movement with splines, enemy
navigation with visualisation and more.
