A good example of what happens when you group 6 programmers, who most have never used Unity
or C# before, and ask them to make a parkour game.

I don't have access to any of the code from this project, just the trailer we needed to put
together for it. Without any artists or anyone with experience in that area, it is far from
good looking.

Far from one of my best works, I like to include it anyway. I implemented most of the level
features such as timers, checkpoints, spawning and finishing and stuff like that. In hindsight,
it doesn't seem like very complex stuff but was very new to me at the time.
