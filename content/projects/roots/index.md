Roots is the current culmination of two to three years of learning Rust with Wgpu.

### Reasons for creating and previous iterations

Over the years of discovering, learning and tinkering with both the concepts of low level graphics and Wgpu, 
I've found myself reinventing the wheel time and time again in the search of the best way to implement features.

All of the above repositories are re-implementations of the Wgpu graphics library, each doing something different
each time, each time improving or doing something in a more specific way.

My most prominent attempts closely interlinked the [Shipyard ECS crate](https://github.com/leudz/shipyard) to create
a partial game engine such as roots_old, cabat, feathered. Each time it felt like it made so much sense to implement
these features directly into an ECS environment, it made it so much harder
