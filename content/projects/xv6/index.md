A minimal/modified version of [the Xv6 OS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xv6) provided by the university as an 
assessment to implement graphical functionality using the VGA buffer. 

Xv6 (to my knowledge) is a minimal, educational
operating system written in a C. It has no standard library and as such, doesn't have some commonplace features such
as boolians, floating points, strings, etc.

This is an assessment I thouroughly enjoyed and scored 100/100 marks in however, as an assessment piece, I won't be 
releasing the full code but will provide some of my accompanying written log.
